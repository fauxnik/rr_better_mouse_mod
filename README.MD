# Better Mouse Mod

This mod for Railroader changes the mouse camera controls.

- No need to **hold** the right mouse button to rotate the camera; instead the camera rotation mode is **toggled** with the right mouse button.
- Camera rotation smoothing is disabled, making the controls much more precise.
- Panning the 3rd person camera with the left mouse button is disabled (optional, through the settings menu of the mod). This prevents accidental panning when miss-clicking.
