# Better Controls Mod

This mod for Railroader changes some game controls. All of these tweaks can be toggled from the mod settings menu (ctrl-F10).

Camera:
- No need to **hold** the right mouse button to rotate the camera; instead the camera rotation mode is **toggled** with the right mouse button.
- Camera rotation smoothing is disabled, making the controls much more precise.
- Panning the 3rd person camera with the left mouse button is disabled. This prevents accidental panning when miss-clicking.

Pause menu:
- Disable closing windows with the escape button, so you can pause without closing all windows (this tweak is disabled by default).
- Pause the game with the pause/break button on your keyboard, so you don't have to close all windows to pause.
